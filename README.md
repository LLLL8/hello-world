# hello-world

I am new to programming. I am currently trying to learn as a hobby through various online resources such as CS50x. The course is available from Edx & HarvardX [Link](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

I will upload my CS50x "homework" projects to the "homework!" repo as seperate branches!
